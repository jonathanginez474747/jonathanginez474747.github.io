      <p> Being a street photographer means to capture life as it is in ordinary situations.<br><br>

       Street photography is a bridge for the audience to witness a day in a different city, state, or country it is the connection to different cultures as well as ethnicities and races which is why I chose to focus on photographing the streets. In order to really document the atmosphere of the day wherever I am at I always check the weather and the sky to see how it affects the mood of city I am in, Usually I take pictures with my iphone or any DSLR I have at the time and go out into a usual day for me.<br><br>

      I snap photos of subjects in situations that catch my eye or I capture a stand still subject that looks different at specific times of the day, week, month, or year. A lot of the times I like to take snapshots of what my friends and I are doing in the day, an insight into me, my friend group, and the culture of the city that we dwell in, two of my projects actually all happened in the span of one day when my friends and I all went to Venice Beach for the day, I captured graffiti art, specific to Los Angeles and picture of two of my friends having a conversation in front of an amazing California beach sunset.<br><br>

      For me street photography was a way to document the city through my perspective and what I see from day to day, It’s a message to a diverse audience that this is what the city is, how it looks like, how it feels, and what it means to me; I like to think of street photography as a portal for those who are unfortunate to experience the city I dwell in so that they may see what had happened on a certain day in L.A. or San Jose. My method is very simple, I don’t really believe I need to be in a certain angle or spot but really I document a photo by the way I initially see it on the first or second time; Fancy bulky cameras are not always needed to capture a what I see because it feels staged and ingenuine to the feel of the city. Photography in general has always been in my life since I was kid, looking at old negatives my parents kept around and comparing them to the actual photos, it was just also a way of remembering things that happened around a certain picture. I want the audience to see my work and connect it with other photographers of the city so that they may piece together how a certain city is in different perspectives.<br><br>
